    <h1 class="center">Philly Phavorites</h1>
    <p class="center border">Food, Music and sight seeing is a basic way to look at Philly.
    The intense battle of who has the best cheesteak is a true debate. Along with
    that, Philly is known for its Reading Terminal Market filled with Philly classics.
    If food really isnt your thing, take a historic trip to the Liberty bell or go hangout with the  Rocky statue at the Art Mueseum.
    Come from a losing city? Take a tour through Lincoln Financial Field and experience
    the feeling of superbowl champs.</p>

    <li><a href="http://www.shellyinreallife.com/2013/01/philly-cheesesteak-in-philly-pats-vs-genos.html">Cheesteaks. Philly's favorite all day meal. Anywhere you go within 20 miles of the city offers their version of the cheesteak.
    Whether its different bread, cheese, or toppings, there is no doubt that a cheesteak is what the city of known for. For decades, two resturaunts
  have been competing over which has the best sandwhich. I guess you are going to have to travel to both and make the decsion.</a></li>
