  <div class=" dark-txt content paragraphfont"><p>These spots are certainly a must go. They have an atmosphere that is uncomparable to <br>
  anything you have ever expereienced. They are authentic, delicious and hip. You will be <br>
  dining with the best and being served by the best. The food is highlighted all over the <br>
  media because everyome agrees it is the most amazing, beating out all of its competition by far <br>
  Miami is known for its fun vibe and certainly wide array of food. Take a weekend to experience <br>
  food from all over the world by staying in one area. The restaurants highlighted on this site are<br>
  Roberta's Pizza, Nusr-Et steakhouse, The Eating <br>House, Macchailina.
</p>
<p class="paragraphfont">If you are looking for a more relaxed atmosphere, Eating House, Robert'as Pizza and Juanchi's<br>
   are all super casual and almost have a bar atmosphere. You can totally get away with wearing <br>
 jeans, which in Miami, is not very common. Just becasue they are casual does not mean their food <br>
is anything boring. They still offer amazing dishes but you do not need to stress about what you are<br>
wearing when you enjoy thir food. </p>
   <p class="paragraphfont">Nusr-Et and Macchailina are a little more nice. They definitely give off a more Miami type of <br>
   vibe and I would get a little more done up to attend these places. They food is extravagant and the <br>
 crowd that goes to these spots definitely know what good food is. They still offer a bar with a <br>
cool interior and you will not see chandalers or white couches, but you will see a modern feel <br>
with random antique looking decorations. </p>
